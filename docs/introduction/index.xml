Admins are advised to take advantage of it by setting low difficulty factors for normal traffic levels for their website.
Lowest advisable difficulty factor is 5000.
For instance, if it is normal for my website to get 2000 requests for every 30 seconds, I will set a cool down period of 30 seconds and the first level of difficulty configuration will have a visitor threshold of 2000 with a difficulty factor of 5000.</description></item></channel></rss>

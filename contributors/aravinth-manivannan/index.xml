TL;DR Codeberg is trying you mCaptcha, Gitea is getting mCaptcha support, mCaptcha supports MariaDB, I&amp;rsquo;ve applied for NLnet and Open Tech Fund, documentation is updated: tutorials and glossary is added and glue libraries have new releases.
Codeberg is deploying mCaptcha Codeberg is committed to trying out mCaptcha to make their platform more accessible: they currently use a text-based CAPTCHA, which will be replaced by mCaptcha.</description></item><item><title>June, 2022: Monthly Report</title><link>/blog/june-2022-monthly-report/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/june-2022-monthly-report/</guid><description>Hello and welcome to the June 2022 edition of the monthly report!
mCaptcha is incorporated! I spent June doing non-technical tasks but I made significant progress: I had been trying to do it since summer 2021, but I faced various setbacks along the way. A family friend, who is also an auditor helped me finally get mCaptcha incorporated!
And we&amp;rsquo;ve already filed successfully filed the first tax return too!

mCaptcha, for a while was showing all the signs of a dead project: no commits on the repositories and no monthly updates. But the project is far from dead!
Python bindings to mCaptcha PoW pow_py contains bindings to pow_sha256, the proof-of-work library that mCaptcha uses. For the uninitiated, the bindings allow for python programs to automatically solve mCaptcha.</description></item><item><title>December, 2021: Monthly Report</title><link>/blog/december-2021-monthly-report/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/december-2021-monthly-report/</guid><description>Hello and welcome to the first edition of the monthly report!
I believe free software like mCaptcha is critical to a healthy internet but being a one-person show, there&amp;rsquo;s hardly any accountability in the way software is built. I hope, through monthly reports, I can explain the logic and intentions behind decisions taken in the development process.
This month, the following things were accomplished:
1. Full LibreJS Compliance The CAPTCHA widget and the admin dashboard are 100% LibreJS compliant!</description></item><item><title>Survey</title><link>/blog/survey/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/survey/</guid><description>Survey link: https://survey.mcaptcha.org/survey/campaigns/b717e51e-24d4-4ab6-912f-de2dfe3ce1fe/about
NOTE: The survey(at least, the lucky draw is temporarily suspended due to some logistical reasons. Apologies for any inconvenience caused.
mCaptcha relies on a proof-of-work(PoW) mechanism to guard against bots. In order for this to be effective, the difficulty factor should be configured properly. If the difficulty factor is too high all the time, it will inconvenience the users and if it&amp;rsquo;s too low during attack, the defence will be weak.</description></item><item><title>PoW performance</title><link>/blog/pow-performance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/pow-performance/</guid><description>mCaptcha uses a proof-of-work(PoW) mechanism to rate limit users or potential bots. In order for this to be effective, the PoW should be configured properly. The difficulty requirement can&amp;rsquo;t be too high, as it could cause accessibility issues on the client-side while at the same time, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too low, as it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t offer proper protection against bots.
Malicious bots(the ones that wreak havoc), run native code which is capable of running in a multi-threaded context.</description></item><item><title>Say hello to mCaptcha</title><link>/blog/say-hello-to-mcaptcha/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/say-hello-to-mcaptcha/</guid><description>At mCaptcha, we believe in digital freedom and privacy and so we built a proof-of-work based CAPTCHA system that doesn&amp;rsquo;t track. Seriously, no tracking. But that isn&amp;rsquo;t the killer feature, our system doesn&amp;rsquo;t require the user to pick cars or ID sidewalks &amp;mdash; our system does it&amp;rsquo;s thing(usually at the click of a button) and gets out of the way.
How does it work? mCaptcha uses SHA256 based proof-of-work(PoW) to rate limit users.</description></item></channel></rss>
